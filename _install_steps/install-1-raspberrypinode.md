# Raspberry Pi Node

To use some of the the scripts in this project, you'll need a Bitcoin Node.

An easy low cost option is a Raspberry Pi based node. Consider following the 
helpful guidance at [node.guide](https://node.guide) on different nodes 
available.  

If you are brand new to Linux then I would recommend the following

- If you want to learn more about the command line, and verify everything
  that you install, then consider [Raspibolt](https://raspibolt.org)
- If you prefer to primarily work from a graphical user interface, and want
  to toggle on apps from a web interface, then consider [MyNodeBTC](https://mynodebtc.org)

Many of the scripts can be run without a Bitcoin node though, so if you're just
looking to setup the display of the current date, the sats per usd, or gas 
prices, you just need a basic Raspberry Pi already setup with the operating
system.

The remainder of this guide assumes that you will be doing the commands on
a Linux operating system that uses systemd and is Debian based.
